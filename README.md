# sandtrails

I saw one of Bruce Shapiro's beautiful sandtables at [Technorama](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rUvCmepszBg) in fall 2019 and immediately fell in love with the idea of tracing sand on a polar plotter.

If you want to have the most beautiful coffee table in the world, buy one at [Sisyphus Industries](https://sisyphus-industries.com). If you want to make a shot at building one yourself, this repository is for you. [Build one](https://ratnaweera.github.io/sandtrails/) and share your insight here.

Thanks to Jeff Eberl's amazing pattern generator [Sandify](https://sandify.org/), your table will never be boring.
